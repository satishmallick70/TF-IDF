# TF-IDF Text Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a **TF-IDF based text classification model** in a single Jupyter Notebook.  
It includes the following:
- Text preprocessing  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Model training, evaluation, and prediction

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- The dataset used for training the model is stored separately due to file size limits.  
- **Download the dataset** from [Google Drive link here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SHTtD9frPoh2PEngDlmM-XftS3QKD65X/view?usp=sharing).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/satishmallick70/TF-IDF.git
    cd TF-IDF
    ```

2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook TF-IDF.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the notebook cells to:
    - Load the dataset  
    - Preprocess the data  
    - Train the TF-IDF model  
    - Evaluate model performance  
    - Make predictions
