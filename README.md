#TF-IDF Text Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a TF-IDF based text classification model in a single Jupyter Notebook.
It includes the following:

Text preprocessing
Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
Model training, evaluation, and prediction
ðŸ“š Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is stored separately due to file size limits.
Download the dataset from Google Drive link here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SHTtD9frPoh2PEngDlmM-XftS3QKD65X/view?usp=sharing).

ðŸš€ How to Run
